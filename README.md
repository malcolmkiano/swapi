# SWAPI (Star Wars API)
A spinoff of the now deprecated [Star Wars API](https://github.com/phalt/swapi) in NodeJS/Express to keep my Star Wars Search app running.

## What I Did
The original was built in Python/Django. I rebuilt it from the ground up in NodeJS, changing some of the features (ie, removing cross-links between data and pulling all related data in one call).

Data ported from JSON to SQL using [Numidian](https://numidian.io/convert).
